AI-Based Form 4 Filing Interpretations for Improved Stock Market Information Availability to Public 
Pratyush Saxena, Winston Wang, Sumedh Anuganti, Prudhvi Kodali



Abstract 
This project provides raw information from SEC Form 4 filings, visual interpretations of this data, and uses an artificial intelligence model to interpret the filings for traders of all levels to better understand the motivation of certain insider transactions. Form 4 filings can offer unique insights into the potential changes in the stock of a company, yet they are often not utilized to their full potential because they are complex to understand and many novice traders aren’t even aware of their existence. Our goal is to create a Flask-based website that uses web scraping techniques to gather data from SEC’s EDGAR API and Yahoo Finance. Then, this data will be analyzed by a model to generate the most likely explanation as to why a certain transaction was made, allowing the public to make more informed decisions in their future trades.


How To Run Code:

Download all code, and run the Flask Server by running app.py
